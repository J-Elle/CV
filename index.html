        <h3>Sales Consultant / Telstra Sylvania (TLS) - 2020-PRESENT</h3>
        <p>Working at Telstra Sylvania I provide frontline customer service and advice to customers, and follow through 
            the order process to ensure the customer receives an appropriate solution tailored to their needs in a timely manner. 
            I am familiar with Telstra’s core products and solutions and can confidently discuss them and provision them for my customer. 
            Through asking my customer appropriate questions, I assist them to find solutions which can include the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Mobile and tablet devices and plans.</li>
                <li>Mobile broadband options including 4g and 5g connectivity.</li>
                <li>Fixed internet solutions on the NBN.</li>
                <li>Network extension options including mesh wi-fi extenders.</li>
                <li>Telstra service solutions including Gaming Optimisation, Cyber security, Tech support packages, Digital Marketing.</li>
                <li>Small business solutions including IOT sims and business phone and internet add-ons such as line hunt.</li>
                <li>Microsoft products including Surface range of laptops and Office 365 software suite.</li>
            </ul>
            I have engaged in continual learning throughout my time in the role. Additional skills I have taken on through self-driven learning 
            includes advanced NBN order remediation and provisioning of small internet solutions, for which I have been credited as a small business 
            champion as part of a Telstra training and development program. I have consistently exceeded my sales and KPI targets and upheld high compliance scores. </p>
